# Shortest Path
This project involved applying the shortest path searching algorithm a-star. Using a map generated in textfiles, we could recreate the map in a graph and then apply the algorithm. We also applied a gaussian function to simulate an epicenter in the middle of the map. We also added functionality to obstruct distinct areas on the map.
